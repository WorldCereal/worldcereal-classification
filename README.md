## Overview

**WorldCereal** is a Python package designed for generating cropland and crop type maps at a wide range of spatial scales, leveraging satellite and auxiliary data, and state-of-the-art classification workflows. It uses [**openEO**](https://openeo.org/) to run classification tasks in the cloud, by default the [**Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE)**](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/). 

Users can leverage the system in a notebook environment through [Terrascope](https://terrascope.be/en) or set up the environment locally using the provided installation options.

In order to run classification jobs on CDSE, users can get started with [monthly free openEO processing credits](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/Quotas.html) by registering on the CDSE platform. Additional credits can be purchased, or users may soon be able to request them through the **ESA Network of Resources**.

## Features

- **Scalable**: Generate maps at a wide range of spatial scales.
- **Cloud-based Processing**: Leverages openEO to run classifications in the cloud.
- **Powerful classification pipeline**: WorldCereal builds upon [Presto](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14065), a pretrained transformer-based model, leveraging global self-supervised learning of multimodal input timeseries, leading to better accuracies and higher generalizability in space and time of downstream crop classification models. The Presto backbone of WorldCereal classification pipelines is developed [here](https://github.com/WorldCereal/presto-worldcereal).
- **Customizable**: Users can pick any region or temporal range and apply either default models or train their own and produce custom maps, interacting with publicly available training data.
- **Easy to Use**: Integrates into Jupyter notebooks and other Python environments.

## Quick Start

One of our [demo notebooks](notebooks) can introduce to you quickly how to map crops with the Worldcereal system. There's two options to run these notebooks:

#### Option 1: Run on Terrascope

You can use a preconfigured environment on [**Terrascope**](https://terrascope.be/en) to run the workflows in a Jupyter notebook environment. Just register as a new user on Terrascope or use one of the supported EGI eduGAIN login methods to get started.

| :point_up:    | Once you are prompted with "Server Options", make sure to select the "Worldcereal" image. Did you choose "Terrascope" by accident? Then go to File > Hub Control Panel > Stop my server, and click the link below once again.  |

- For a croptype map generation demo with model training: <a href="https://notebooks.terrascope.be/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FWorldCereal%2Fworldcereal-classification&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fworldcereal-classification%2Fnotebooks%2Fworldcereal_v1_demo_custom_croptype.ipynb&branch=main"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/run%20croptype%20demo-Terrascope-brightgreen" alt="Run croptype demo" valign="middle"></a>

#### Option 2: Install Locally

If you prefer to install the package locally, you can create the environment using **Conda** or **pip**.

First clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/WorldCereal/worldcereal-classification.git
cd worldcereal-classification
```
Next, install the package locally:
- for Conda: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
- for Pip: `pip install .`

## Usage Example
In it's most simple form, a cropland mask can be generated with just few lines of code, triggering an openEO job on CDSE and downloading the result locally:

```python
from openeo_gfmap import BoundingBoxExtent, TemporalContext
from worldcereal.job import generate_map

# Specify the spatial extent
spatial_extent = BoundingBoxExtent(
    west=44.432274,
    south=51.317362,
    east=44.698802,
    north=51.428224,
    epsg=4326
)

# Specify the temporal extent (this has to be one year)
temporal_extent = TemporalContext('2022-11-01', '2023-10-31')

# Launch processing job (result will automatically be downloaded)
results = generate_map(spatial_extent, temporal_extent, output_dir='.')
```

WorldCereal's classification backbone makes use of the Presto model, originally implemented [here](https://github.com/nasaharvest/presto/). Without the groundbreaking work being done by Gabriel Tseng and the rest of the [NASA Harvest](https://www.nasaharvest.org/) team, both in the original Presto implementation as well as its adaptation for WorldCereal, this package would simply not exist in its present form üôè.
