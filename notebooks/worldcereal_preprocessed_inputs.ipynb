    "## Extracting pre-processed inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how you can extract, for one or multiple patches, pre-processed satellite time series required for running a cropland or crop type model locally on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a set of patches available comes in handy during the development of a custom crop type model. It allows you to quickly test different model set-ups, as each time you have trained a new model, you can immediately apply it to the same set of patches and check for improvements. By not having to deploy and run the model on CDSE, this drastically reduces the time required to get to your ideal crop model!\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "All you need to specify is:\n",
    "- the geometry of one or multiple patches (in case the patches are large, they will be split)\n",
    "- start and end date of the time series to be extracted (can be specified per patch)\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook will then launch, for each of the specified geometries, an OpenEO processing job on the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE) extracting all relevant Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, meteo and digital elevation information that is used by the WorldCereal classification algorithms to predict cropland and crop types.\n",

    "Keep in mind that these extraction jobs will be billed on your CDSE account, so start small and evaluate the cost!<br>\n",
