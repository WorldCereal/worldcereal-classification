Presto was pre-trained on millions of unlabeled samples around the world and finetuned on global labelled land cover and crop type data from the WorldCereal reference database. The resulting 128 *embeddings* (`presto_ft_0` -> `presto_ft_127`) nicely condense the Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, meteo timeseries and ancillary data for your season of interest into a limited number of meaningful features which we will use for downstream model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide several options aimed at increasing temporal robustness and handling real-world data gaps in your final crop model. This is controlled by the following arguments:\n",
    "- `augment` parameter: when set to `True`, introduces slight temporal jittering of the processing window, making the model more robust to variations in seasonality across different years. By default, this option is set to `True`, but especially when training a model for a specific region and year with good local data, disabling this option could be considered.\n",
    "- `mask_on_training` parameter: when `True`, applies sensor masking augmentations (e.g., simulating S1/S2 dropouts, additional clouds, ancillary feature removals) only to the training split to improve robustness to real-world data gaps. The validation/test split is kept untouched for fair evaluation. This is enabled by default (`True`).\n",
    "- `repeats` parameter: number of times each training sample is (re)drawn with its augmentations. Higher values (>1) create more variants (with jitter/masking) and enlarge the effective training set, potentially improving generalization at the cost of longer embedding computation time. Default is 3.\n",
