    "\n",
    "You can use a preconfigured environment on [**Terrascope**](https://terrascope.be/en) to run the workflows in a Jupyter notebook environment. Just register as a new user on Terrascope or use one of the supported EGI eduGAIN login methods to get started.\n",

    "\n",
    "The best timing to start and end the time series in this case would be October (green vertical line), as for both seasons this would result in nicely capturing the growing season within the time series. It would not make sense in this case to define the year from June to June (red vertical line), as you will miss the start of the summer season and the end of the winter season in your time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you would like to map temporary crops in Western Europe for the year 2021, we would recommend to define your processing period as October 1st 2020 - September 30th 2021.\n",
