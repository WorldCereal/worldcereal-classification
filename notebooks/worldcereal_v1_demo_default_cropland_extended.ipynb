Sugar cane, asparagus, and cassava are also considered temporary crops, even though they remain in the field for more than 1 year. This cropland definition thus excludes perennial crops as well as (temporary) pastures.\n",

It would not make sense in this case to define the year from June to June (red vertical line), as you will miss the start of the summer season and the end of the winter season in your time series.\n",
